# Eye of Things

Expandable Dashboard for your Digital Life; tackling the challenge of all the different things that are available, but not uniformly.

Integrating ASBase, IFTTT and Wolfram DataDrop

Defining the general data schema with user ID, system name, activity type, timestamp, and location.

ETL from ASBase via Python script for extracting data and then import it to DataDrop.

Complete DataDrop export as CSV, then doing everything client-side.

Visualization shows timeline with dots, filtered by system/activity combination (all combinations available by drop down).


# Seats and Spaces

Trying to find open seats in libraries and potentially public places like cafes and public transport.

Number of activities to create and manage reservations, and to check and update seat status.

Arduino-based hardware with force sensor and wifi connectivity.

Smartphone app for showing chair status and making reservations.

Using the admin console to approve or deny requests for seats, which then updates the status on the smartphone app.

ASBase standard schema worked pretty well for a lot of the actions, posting activities was easy.

Challenging was the fact that the objects (spaces) felt like second-class citizens, and querying was not as powerful as would have been nice.

Integration with BART by consuming trainRecord and republishing as trainRecordwithSeatInfo (adding available seat information)
