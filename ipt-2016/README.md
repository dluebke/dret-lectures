# API Landscaping

APIs are the contracts that make interconnected applications work. They need some stability, but the increasing speed of how APIs are developed and changed, such as in Microservices approaches, are challenging the classical process of how API management is done. One possible approach towards a more agile way of API management is to embrace the lessons and approaches of the Web. By looking at a service and API landscape as a constantly evolving open ecosystem, innovation and speed of change are easier to manage than with top-down controls.
