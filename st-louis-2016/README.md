# What the Web can teach us about Microservices

Microservice Architecture formalizes a model that service development has followed for well over two decades: Allow many flowers to bloom, decouple radically, focus on the interface, and allow for experimentation and failure. The experience gathered from Web Architecture can be used as guidance for establishing and cultivating a Microservice Architecture. This presentation looks at lessons that can be derived from Web Architecture, and can serve as guidance when planning and implementing a Microservice strategy.
