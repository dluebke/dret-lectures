main picture:

make vocabularies narrow and shallow, they are for communication agreement, not world description.

- the abyss of abstraction (avoid "upper ontology" trap until you need abstract types)
- the expanse of ...
- the illusion of order ("tagging" may be better than "filing" when describing things, also see the note about avoiding upper ontologies)

focus on how vocabularies fit into the communication process. the web doesn't thrive on shared world models, it thrives on actionable communication models
