main picture:

focus on actions and not on things; things are secondary to actions. what needs agreement and the actions, and then in the scope of these actions the things that are required for them. what matters most is that actors are able to communicate; the actions then should be based on thing models that are as shallow and narrow as possible.

focus on how vocabularies fit into the communication process. the web doesn't thrive on shared world models, it thrives on actionable communication models.

- shared world models are good for tight coupling and close collaboration
- "opaque" world models are good for loose coupling and spontaneous interactions

create picture that contrasts traditional "knowledge/resource engineering" versus "interaction vocabulary engineering". reinforce the idea of "shallow and narrow" by visualizing that vocabularies should be self-contained and tightly constrained interaction models, and not sprawling world models that try to interconnect everything.

generally speaking, the main topic should be to encourage thinking in "bounded contexts" instead of trying to build a tightly interconnected web of concepts of everything. this is not necessarily conflicting, but it makes things more challenging. interested peers should *only* be required to accept as few of these bounded contexts as possible, and ideally these should be self-contained (i.e., no dependencies on models that might change outside of the scope of the bounded context).

add something explaining the difference between just data and hypermedia, explaining that "knowledge engineering" is just one way of defining the fundamental data space, but that for doing things well on the web, you also have to think about access patterns and support them through hypermedia.
