main picture:

make vocabularies narrow and shallow, they are for communication agreement, not for world description.

focus on actions and not on things; things are secondary to actions. what matters most is that actors are able to communicate; the actions then should have thing models that are as shallow and narrow as possible.

- the abyss of abstraction (avoid "upper ontology" trap until you need abstract types)
- the expanse of ...
- the illusion of order ("tagging" may be better than "filing" when describing things, also see the note about avoiding upper ontologies)

focus on how vocabularies fit into the communication process. the web doesn't thrive on shared world models, it thrives on actionable communication models.

create picture that contrasts traditional "knowledge/resource engineering" versus "interaction vocabulary engineering". reinforce the idea of "shallow and narrow" by visualizing that vocabularies should be self-contained and tightly constrained interaction models, and not sprawling world models that try to interconnect everything.
