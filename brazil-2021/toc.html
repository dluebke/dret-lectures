						<td valign="top"><b><span class="title">How to Establish an Effective API Culture</span>:</b> The most valuable as well as challenging aspects of using APIs are not just about technology. One such aspect is the organizational aspect, which looks at how API strategy needs to be aligned with team structures so that teams can create and deliver the self-contained and reusable capabilities that APIs make accessible. Another such aspect is the business aspect, which looks at how a faster-paced world means that organizations must become better at adapting to changing environments. This presentation looks at what it takes to make the most out of APIs. What does your organization need to do so that APIs can become the change agent that they are supposed to be?</td>

						<td valign="top"><b><span class="title">API Strategy, Programs, and Platforms</span>:</b> APIs are essential for both digital transformation of organizations and for participating in the digital economy. While these goals may seem different, the most effective way for organizations to adopt APIs is to see them as two sides of the same coin. An API strategy should cover all uses of APIs, both for private APIs for internal purposes, and for partner and public APIs for externally-facing purposes. An API program should be planned and executed to cover all these API scenarios, so that APIs can be planned, designed, implemented, discovered, and used coherently. One important part of the API program is to establish an API platform that becomes the foundation of digital resources and capabilities within the organization. This presentation looks at how these different pieces of strategy, program, and platform fit together, and what the deciding factors are when it comes to making sure that APIs are used in an effective and productive manner.</td>

						<td valign="top"><b><span class="title">Microservices and DevOps: Using APIs for Increased Velocity</span>:</b> Microservices come with the promise of decreasing the dependencies between teams and thereby increasing the velocity of developing and evolving digital capabilities. While Microservices can help with that, it is important to understand that they are just an architecture pattern, and that other aspects are equally important for realizing the promise of Microservices. One of these aspects is DevOps which means that teams have more autonomy and responsibility regarding the operational aspects of the services that they own. In this presentation we look at how Microservices and DevOps relate, and which other aspects are equally important when it comes to increasing the velocity of your organization.</td>
