# Microservice Matters

Microservices promise to provide a new approach of disentangling complex solutions, and do so by providing teams with more autonomy and thus allowing the service landscape to evolve more freely and more loosely coupled. This talk looks into organizational, technological, cultural, and methodical issues of microservice architecture. It presents a framework for how and why microservices can make a difference in an IT strategy, and also highlights the areas that require careful attention when planning and executing a microservices strategy.
