Lectures

University courses and other presentations, mostly covering Web Architecture, REST, SOA, XML (XSLT/XSD), and similar stuff.

These are sources for educational/professional presentations that I make available for others to read/use/reuse; please respect [the licensing](LICENSE).

Online
------

Online versions of the actual presentations can be found at http://dret.net/netdret/publications#presentations (or as a list of all university courses at http://dret.net/lectures/), but older presentations you see there are not part of the GitHub repo (I may change that if I find the time to move them from their older svn home to the new GitHub repo).
