# The Web Engineering Challenge

The scale, dynamics, and robustness of the Web as a decentralized information system are unparalleled in history. Since the Web took off, Web engineering has tried to identify and reuse principles and patterns that were identified as the foundations for this success story. The latest development in this space are microservices, which take a refreshingly new approach by focusing on the organizational and cultural principles underlying the design and development of IT components. In this talk we take a closer look at how microservices compare to previous approaches of using the Web as inspiration for IT design and development. The result of this closer look is the identification of a few trends that are the drivers behind the current microservices adoption, and the identification of some areas where additional work is required to better fulfill the promise of Web-scale robustness and scalability.
