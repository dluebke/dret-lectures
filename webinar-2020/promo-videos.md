### Making API Teams More Effective

Hello! I am Erik Wilde, and I'd like to welcome you to the "Around the Corner" series of presentations. In this series, the Catalyst team of Axway will look into topics around digital transformation and strategy. Join me for the first event where we will talk about how to make API teams more effective. We will look at the typical challenges around how to start and scale API initiatives, and we'll discuss how establishing and evolving API guidelines can be a very effective way how to support teams with their API products. See you soon!
