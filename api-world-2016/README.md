# What the Web can teach us about Microservices

Looking to the Web for inspiration, this talk will discuss how service discovery and service evolution will increasingly matter in growing microservice ecosystems. Microservices currently focus on development speed and safety, delivered at scale. This talk looks at two currently not so popular topics in this space, specifically at service discovery and service evolution, and how they will increasingly matter in growing microservice ecosystems. Specifically, we will look to the Web for inspiration, which has been a successfully evolving service ecosystem for quite a while.
