# USAA API Workshop

*Microservice Architecture* and *Microservices* embrace a new style of IT development and culture that focuses on speed, safety, robustness, and scalability. Taking the ideas of agile development and CI/CD one step further, microservices embrace organizational changes as well, so that improved IT processes are not compromised by the side-effects of organizational realities.

*Microservice Architecture* describes a model that service development has followed for well over two decades: Allow many flowers to bloom, decouple radically, focus on the interface, and allow for rapid experimentation and failure. The experience gathered from *Web Architecture* can be used as guidance for establishing and cultivating a successful Microservice Architecture. This presentation looks at lessons that can be derived from Web Architecture, and can serve as guidance when planning and implementing a Microservice strategy.
