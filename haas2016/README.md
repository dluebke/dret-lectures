# From Data to Services

This talk highlights how the current focus on "Big Data" mirrors a development in software engineering. Big enterprise software is still in use today, but the last decade has seen a major trend to move from large monoliths to decoupled smaller software units. Software development practices have followed suit, moving from large waterfall processes to incremental agile models. A similar development is likely to happen for data, where an increasing usage and dependency on data-driven processes will make it increasingly important to decouple processes, so that the data-driven landscape can evolve more quickly and in a decentralized way.
