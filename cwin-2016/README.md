# Microservice Matters

Microservices promise to provide a new approach for disentangling complex solutions. They do so by providing teams with more autonomy, thus allowing the service landscape to evolve more freely and in a loosely-coupled way. This talk looks into the organizational, technological, cultural, and methodical aspects of microservice architecture. It presents a framework for how and why microservices can make a difference in an IT strategy, and also highlights the areas that require careful attention when planning and implementing a microservices approach.
