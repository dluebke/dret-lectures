# Microservices & Beyond

Microservice Architecture tells providers to "embrace the chaos" in order to increase the speed of service development, deployment, and availability. As an architecture the style does not define any concrete technologies, and in fact makes it clear that any prescription of technologies constrains a Microservice landscape in ways that are against the architectural style. Nourishing a thriving Microservice landscape is a balancing act between encouraging some best practices so that some common patterns emerge, and making sure that these best practices are not a relapse into the strict boundaries established in previous SOA approaches such as the SOAP/WSDL model.
