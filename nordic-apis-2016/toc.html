							<b><span class="summary">Microservice Gardening</span><span class="toggle">:</span></b> <span class="toggle"><span class="description">Microservices as an architectural approach are a logical consequence of the containerization of software infrastructure. Microservices as the result of a containerized landscape require a different mindset and management approach for keeping track of the more diverse, dynamic, and decentralized set of services. This talk takes a closer look at those places where becoming an effective microservice gardener presents some challenges, and where lessons learned from existing decentralized systems can present us with solutions that have been practiced and perfected since the Web turned into the largest containerized microservices ecosystem about 25 years ago.</span></span>

							<b><span class="summary">Complexity of Mobile and IoT Ecosystems</span><span class="toggle">:</span></b> <span class="toggle"><span class="description"><em>Mobile</em> and the <em>Internet of Things (IoT)</em> are two examples of particularly rapidly evolving ecosystems. In both cases, the diversity and rate of change (in mobile devices as well as in IoT "things") are challenging factors. This means that it is essential to have an IT architecture in place that provides both the stability and the flexibility to be able to handle the changing landscape. Cleanly identifying and managing services is a foundation that can then be used to quickly and robustly build mobile applications that are based on IoT services.</span></span>
