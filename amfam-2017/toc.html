						<td valign="top"><b>API Contracts:</b> <span class="description">The current focus around API documentation is on the technical side and how to describe an existing service so that it can be consumed.

There are both design and management challenges to this, so that one the one hand API producers and consumers are loosely coupled, but on the other hand there is a design in place that minimizes breakage in a large landscape of APIs.</span></td>
