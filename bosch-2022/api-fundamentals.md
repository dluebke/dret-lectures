# API Fundamentals

## What are APIs and why do we need them?

- APIs are interfaces for machines
- [[Bosch: lawn mower using weather API and exposing APIs]] IoT oder anderes Bosch-relevantes Beispiel
- Weather report example (UI vs. API)
- Weather report API observations: "Ask a question" style; Based on the Web's foundational protocol; Using a format that's easy to process programmatically

## How APIs help modern Organizations

- Digitalisierung (HBR definition)
- Automatisierung (you have to be able to write code, Bosch Beispiele mit dem Weather API)
- Platformization (business models based on external partners, [[Bosch]] Gibt es "Platform Business Models" bei Bosch? E-bike? lawn mower? heating systems for maintenance with licensed API access?)
- [[Bosch]] Bosch Zentralanweisung, CD 07061, ITD 2025, CI API Enablement Initiative

## What is a (Good) API?

- Being useful is more important than being usable
- Being findable is not as easy as it may sound (Marketplace, Developer Portals)

## API Perspectives

### Private/Partner/Public

- Scopes/context from API 101 Slides
- Comparison with internal/external (target consumers vs. technical accessibility)
- Private/Partner/Public (Weather API Example)
- Managing privacy/visibility

### System/Process/Experience

- Unified APIs (unified models exposed from systems, unified weather)
- COTS APIs (SAP) vs. in-house developments

### API Types (5-10 min)

- Tunnel/RPC
- Resource
- Hypermedia
- Query
- Events

### API Technologies (5-10 min)

- WSDL/SOAP/XML
- OpenAPI/HTTP/JSON (Weather API Beispiel)
- GraphQL (Weather API Beispiel)
- AsyncAPI (Weather API Beispiel)
- gRPC
- Kafka
- MQTT

## API Products

- API First
- Outside-in Design
- DX
- Catalogs and Marketplaces

## The API Lifecycle

- API Design: Designing products for a market
- API Implementation: Microservices and other time-to-market tricks
- Secure: Opening everything comes with some risks
- Govern: Avoid the curse of shadow and zombie APIs
- Publish/Consume: Products work best when people can find them
- Analyze: Consumer needs and consumers change
