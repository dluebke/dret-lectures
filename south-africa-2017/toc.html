							<b><span class="summary">Establishing a Foundation for Microservices</span><span class="toggle">:</span></b> <span class="toggle"><span class="description"><em>Microservices</em> are a hot topic these days, because companies are under increasing pressure to innovate faster, to change faster, and to adapt faster. This presentation looks at the <em>why</em>, the <em>what</em>, and the <em>how</em> of microservices. This perspective provides a good overview of why microservices have become popular, what problems they are focusing on specifically, and how they are doing it.</span></span>

							<b><span class="summary">Designing Microservice APIs</span><span class="toggle">:</span></b> <span class="toggle"><span class="description">Microservices as an architectural approach are a logical consequence of the containerization of software infrastructure. Microservices as the result of a containerized landscape require a different mindset and management approach for keeping track of the more diverse, dynamic, and decentralized set of services. This talk takes a closer look at those places where becoming an effective microservice gardener presents some challenges, and where lessons learned from existing decentralized systems can present us with solutions that have been practiced and perfected since the Web turned into the largest containerized microservices ecosystem about 25 years ago.</span></span>
